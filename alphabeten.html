                        <h1>Old English Latin Alphabet</h1>
                    </header>
                    <p><b>Old English Latin alphabet or Anglo-Saxon Latin alphabet </b> is one of the two scripts of Old English. As a rule, it consisted of 24 letters and was used for writing in the 9th — 12th centuries. Of these, 20 were directly Latin letters, two modifications of the Latin letters (Ææ, Ðð), and two graphemes borrowed from the runic alphabet (Þþ, Ƿƿ). The letters K, Q and Z were not used in the writing of the Anglo-Saxon words.</p>
                    <h1>A B C D E F G H I L M N O P R S T U X Y Ƿ Þ Ð Æ</h1>
                    <p>In 1011, the writer-hagiographer Birtfert ordered the alphabet for numerological purposes. He listed 24 basic letters of the Latin alphabet, and then another 5 English letters, as a result of which he received an alphabet of 29 characters:</p>
                    <h1>A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T U X Y Z & ⁊ Ƿ Þ Ð Æ</h1>
                    <p>The Latin alphabet was one of the two systems used by the Anglo-Saxons, along with runic writing</p>

                    <h2>Changes in modern editions</h2>
                    <p>In the present period, in the published editions in Old English (including the Anglo-Saxon language section of Wikipedia), symbols are being replaced for arranging the letter. The long s (ſ) is replaced by the modern analogue s. The island g is usually replaced by the modern g. In addition, in modern editions, velor and palatal c (ċ) and g (ġ) are distinguished, using the diacritical points above them. The letter Ƿ (wynn) is replaced by w. Macrons are used to denote long vowels, but they are usually absent in the original. Acute in old prints was used to maintain the connection between Old English and Old Norse.</p>
                    <h1>A Ā Æ Ǣ B C Ċ D Ð E Ę Ē F G Ġ H I Ī K L M N O Ō P Q R S T Þ U Ū W X Y Ȳ Z</h1>
                    <p>V, J are not used, and K, Q, Z - are used very rarely.</p>

Grandees arbitrarily embarrassed the people, the judges did not respect the jury. Alfred compiled the first collection of national laws ("The Truth of King Alfred"), ordering to expound in the Anglo-Saxon language the laws of various Saxon kings, selecting the most suitable. </p>
