                        <p><b>OLD ENGLISH</b> - an early form of English, common in the territory of present England and southern Scotland from the middle of the V to the middle of the XII century. The Old English language was a West Germanic language and, therefore, was close to Old Frisian and Old Saxon languages. Compared with modern English, the Old English was morphologically more rich and resembled modern Icelandic, and its orthography more directly reflected the pronunciation. He had five cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and instrumental (the latter had a special form only in pronouns and adjectives, and in the oldest monuments - and nouns of masculine and neuter gender singular); three numbers: single, dual and multiple; and three kinds: masculine, feminine and average.</p>

                            <h3>Alphabet</h3>
                            <p>The Old English Latin alphabet or the Anglo-Saxon Latin alphabet is one of the two Old English scripts. As a rule, it consisted of 24 letters and was used for writing in the 9th-12th centuries. Of these, 20 were directly Latin letters, two versions of Latin letters (Ææ, Ðð), and two graphemes were borrowed from the runic alphabet (Þþ, Ƿƿ). The letters K, Q and Z were not used in writing Anglo-Saxon words.</p>

                            <p>Grammar of the Old English language is quite different from the grammar of modern English. Being one of the ancient Germanic languages, the Old English has a morphological system that is similar to the Pragermanic, preserving many of the changes that were common in the Indo-European language, as well as the characteristic elements of German grammar, for example, umlaut.</p>
